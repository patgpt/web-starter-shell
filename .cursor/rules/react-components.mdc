# Styling 

- ALWAYS Use dailsyUI classes wherever possible
- ALWAYS built to be responsive using tailwind utility functions
- ALWAYS use tailwind utilities to improve a11y
- If a tailwind class string in `className` is used more than once ALWAYS extract it to a `tailwindcss` `@utility` or `component` in `globals.css`
- Support light and Dark mode

# Typescript types
- If a 3rd party package is used ALWAYS import the official type from the package directory and create a type alias and extend if nessesary
- ALWAYS Create generic types wherever possible

# Comments 
- ALWAYS TSDoc in detail with `@description` and `@example` each component upon creation or modification 

# Stories and Tests
- ALWAYS Create a corresponding `component.story.tsx` and `component.spec.ts` for each component created, update on modification. 

# a11y and i18n 
- ALWAYS make the component completely `i18n` and `a11y` friednly. In cases when it can not be done with html, jsx or css prompt user for guidance. 

# Design Pattern 
- opt for atomic design pattern

# Documentation 
- Upon creation and completion or update of a component implementation ALWAYS add documentation and examples to the `apps/docs` website.
